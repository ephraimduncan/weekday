        At Weekday, we believe that privacy is a fundamental right. Our
        open-source calendar solution with AI features is built with privacy at
        its core, and we're committed to being transparent about how we handle

        application. We DO NOT store your calendar events on our servers. All
        calendar data is processed directly between your browser and Google
        Calendar.
