# T3 Stack with Better-Auth

This is a modified version of the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project, originally created by [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg) and bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`. This version replaces NextAuth.js with Better-Auth for improved authentication handling.

## What's different in this template?

This template builds upon the excellent T3 Stack but replaces NextAuth.js with Better-Auth for a more streamlined authentication experience. The rest of the powerful T3 Stack features remain intact.
